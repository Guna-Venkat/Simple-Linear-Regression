# Simple-Linear-Regression

### Read this file before proceeding to the code.

By this simple project in python you can understand how Linear Regression works.

In this project we are going to understand Linear Regression manner
For simplicity let's consider the output(y) depends on one feature(x)
In mathematics we might have studied about a simple straight line of the form y = mx + c
where m = 'slope' and c = 'y-intercept'
This is the same concept that's been used by Linear Regression algorithm.

I hope you got a clear understanding how Linear Regression algorithm works, now loot at the code

# P.S : I also included the 'csv' file in the repository so you can work on it.
